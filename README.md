# PYFolders
by Lewis L. Foster

PYFolders is a very terrible python-based programming language that uses folders instead of regular text files.
In this repository there is a zip file what is an example project, extract that and simply run `python3 main.py FR:test`

## OS Testing
This script has only be tested on Linux (specifically Ubuntu 21.04), other operating systems/versions may behave differently. No fixes will be made due to this project only being a joke and because I was bored but feel free to fork and create a pull request to fix it

### OSes
